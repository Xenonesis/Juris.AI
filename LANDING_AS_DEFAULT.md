# Landing Page as Default Route

## 🎯 Overview
Updated the application to show the landing page as the default for non-logged-in users on the main route (`/`) instead of redirecting to a separate `/landing` route.

## 🔄 Changes Made

### 1. Main Route (`/src/app/page.tsx`)
**Before:**
- Redirected non-authenticated users to `/landing`
- Showed Legal Advisor for authenticated users

**After:**
- Shows landing page directly for non-authenticated users
- Shows Legal Advisor for authenticated users (unchanged)
- No more redirects for non-authenticated users

### 2. Landing Page Component (`/src/components/landing/optimized-landing-page.tsx`)
**Before:**
- Had authentication checking logic
- Redirected authenticated users to main page
- Had loading states for auth checks

**After:**
- Simplified to just show content
- No authentication logic (handled by parent)
- Pure presentation component

### 3. Landing Route (`/src/app/landing/page.tsx`)
**Before:**
- Showed the landing page content
- Redirected authenticated users to main page

**After:**
- Redirects all users to main page (`/`)
- Acts as a fallback for any old bookmarks/links

## 🎉 Benefits

## 🔍 User Flow

### For Non-Authenticated Users
1. Visit `/` (or any `/landing` links)
2. See landing page immediately
3. Click "Start Free Analysis" → Go to login
4. After login → See Legal Advisor dashboard

### For Authenticated Users
1. Visit `/` → See Legal Advisor dashboard immediately
2. Visit `/landing` → Redirect to main page

## 🛠️ Implementation Details

### Authentication Flow
```typescript
// Main page now handles both states
export default function Home() {
  const { user, isLoading } = useAuth();

  if (isLoading) {
    return <LoadingSpinner />;
  }

  if (user) {
    return <LegalAdvisor />; // Authenticated view
  }

  return <OptimizedLandingPage />; // Non-authenticated view
}
```
