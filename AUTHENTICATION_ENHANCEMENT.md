# Authentication Enhancement - Terms of Service & Privacy Policy

## Overview

Enhanced the Juris.AI authentication system to match the website's design and enforce Terms of Service and Privacy Policy acceptance.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Enhanced UI/UX Design
- **Gradient Backgrounds**: Matching the website's blue-purple gradient theme
- **Animated Logo**: Juris.AI logo with rotating sparkles animation
- **Modern Card Design**: Glass-morphism effect with backdrop blur
- **Responsive Layout**: Mobile-first design with proper spacing
- **Framer Motion Animations**: Smooth entrance animations

### 2. Terms & Privacy Policy Enforcement
- **Mandatory Acceptance**: Users must accept both Terms of Service and Privacy Policy
- **Database Tracking**: Stores acceptance timestamps in user profiles
- **Existing User Dialog**: Shows dialog for existing users who haven't accepted
- **Real-time Validation**: Form validation prevents submission without acceptance
- **External Links**: Links open Terms and Privacy pages in new tabs

### 3. Database Schema Updates
- Added `accepted_terms` boolean field
- Added `accepted_privacy` boolean field  
- Added `terms_accepted_at` timestamp field
- Added `privacy_accepted_at` timestamp field
- Created indexes for performance
- Added RLS policies for security

## Files Modified/Created

### New Components
- `src/components/auth/terms-acceptance-dialog.tsx` - Dialog for existing users
- `src/lib/terms-acceptance.ts` - Utility functions for terms management

### Enhanced Components  
- `src/app/auth/login/page.tsx` - New design matching website theme
- `src/components/auth/auth-form.tsx` - Added terms acceptance checkboxes
- `src/app/layout.tsx` - Added TermsAcceptanceDialog component

### Database
- `sql/add_terms_acceptance.sql` - Migration for terms tracking
- `supabase/migrations/[timestamp]_add_terms_acceptance.sql` - Supabase migration

## Usage

### For New Users
1. Users see enhanced login page with website-matching design
2. Must check both Terms of Service and Privacy Policy checkboxes
3. Cannot submit form until both are accepted
4. Acceptance is stored in database with timestamps

### For Existing Users
1. Dialog automatically appears on login if terms not accepted
2. Must read and accept both documents to continue
3. Can decline and be signed out
4. Acceptance updates their profile in database

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend
- React components with TypeScript
- Framer Motion for animations
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Radix UI for accessible components

### Backend
- Supabase for authentication and database
- PostgreSQL for data storage
- Row Level Security (RLS) for data protection
- Triggers for automatic profile creation

### Security Features
- Terms acceptance tracked with timestamps
- User cannot bypass acceptance requirement
- Secure database policies
- Audit trail of acceptance events

## Future Enhancements

1. **Version Tracking**: Track different versions of terms/privacy policy
2. **Email Notifications**: Send confirmation emails when terms are accepted
3. **Admin Dashboard**: View acceptance statistics and compliance
4. **Bulk Updates**: Handle mass terms updates for all users
5. **Legal Compliance**: Add GDPR/CCPA compliance features

## Testing

To test the implementation:

1. **New User Flow**:
   - Go to `/auth/login`
   - Try to sign up without checking boxes (should show error)
   - Check boxes and sign up (should work)

2. **Existing User Flow**:
   - Sign in with existing account
   - Dialog should appear if terms not previously accepted
   - Test both accept and decline flows

3. **Database Verification**:
   - Check `profiles` table for acceptance fields
   - Verify timestamps are recorded correctly
   - Test RLS policies work properly

## Dependencies

- `@radix-ui/react-checkbox` - Accessible checkbox component
- `@radix-ui/react-dialog` - Modal dialog component  
- `framer-motion` - Animation library
- `lucide-react` - Icon library
- `@supabase/supabase-js` - Supabase client

## Deployment Notes

1. Run the database migration before deploying
2. Ensure all environment variables are set
3. Test authentication flow in staging environment
4. Monitor for any authentication errors after deployment
