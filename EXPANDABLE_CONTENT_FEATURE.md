# Expandable Content Feature Implementation

## ðŸŽ¯ Problem Solved

**Issue**: Legal analysis results were being truncated without providing users a way to view the complete content, especially for very long responses.

**Solution**: Implemented a comprehensive expandable content system with "Read More" functionality and fullscreen viewing options.

## âœ¨ Features Implemented

### 1. Smart Content Detection
- **Automatic Detection**: Content longer than 1000 characters or with more than 5 paragraphs automatically gets "Read More" functionality
- **Intelligent Truncation**: Shows first 3 paragraphs or 800 characters (whichever is shorter) in collapsed state
- **Paragraph-Aware**: Respects paragraph boundaries when truncating content

### 2. Expandable Content Controls
- **Read More Button**: Smooth expansion to show full content
- **Show Less Button**: Collapse back to truncated view
- **Smooth Animations**: Fade transitions between expanded/collapsed states
- **Visual Indicators**: Shows "... and X more sections" when content is truncated

### 3. Fullscreen Mode
- **Fullscreen Toggle**: Maximize button for immersive reading experience
- **Backdrop Blur**: Professional overlay with backdrop blur effect
- **Enhanced Typography**: Larger text and better spacing in fullscreen mode
- **Custom Scrolling**: Styled scrollbars for better UX

### 4. Responsive Design
- **Mobile Optimized**: Smaller text and adjusted spacing on mobile devices
- **Touch Friendly**: Properly sized buttons for touch interaction
- **Adaptive Layout**: Fullscreen mode adjusts to different screen sizes

### 5. Accessibility Features
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Focus-visible outlines for keyboard users
- **Screen Reader Friendly**: Proper ARIA labels and semantic HTML
- **High Contrast Support**: Works well in both light and dark modes
