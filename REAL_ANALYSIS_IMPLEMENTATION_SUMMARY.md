### Performance Metrics Calculation
```typescript
interface RealPerformanceMetrics {
  accuracy: number;        // Content quality and correctness
  responseTime: number;    // Actual API response time
  relevance: number;       // Query-response matching
  reasoning: number;       // Logical structure quality
  overall: number;         // Weighted composite score
  wordCount: number;       // Response comprehensiveness
  sentenceComplexity: number; // Language sophistication
  legalTermDensity: number;   // Professional terminology usage
  citationCount: number;      // Legal precedent references
  structureScore: number;     // Organization and formatting
}
```

### Real-Time Analysis Flow
